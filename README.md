## React Homerwork

This repository contains my homework for a React course.

### Boilerplate used

For the purposes of this homework I used a boilerplate kindly provided by our lector William Abboud (https://github.com/william-abboud).

One can find the boilerplate here: https://github.com/william-abboud/webpack-config.
